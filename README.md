# Company Analysis Model
This repository contains an Excel file used to develop a detailed company analysis. The firm at issue is the Chinese-based Xiaomi listed at the Hong Kong stock exchange under the ticker 1810.HK. The data come mainly from the investor relations website of the company itself (https://ir.mi.com/).
## Description
The Excel file is pretty much self-explanatory on the condition that the reader has already knowledge in the field of company valuation, nonetheless, some comments are present within the file to help the reader in understanding it.

The models used to carry out this analysis are: Discounted Cash Flow Model, multiples and competitors analysis (the second sheet of the Excel file is committed to this last model).

The goal of this analysis is to forecast the future price of Xiaomi in a 10 years period.

## Remarks
The analysis is going to be updated every quarter by the author after each quarterly earnings released by the company. Starting from the second half of 2024, the analysis will be upgraded by including the revenues coming from the initial sales of the new Xiaomi SU7 electric car.

Furthermore, the author is committed to implementing the same analysis by means of coding. In particular, I will try to automate the process of company analysis by creating a model in Python such that every listed company can be quickly analysed just by changing the data within the code.
